            <h1>Dear Andrew,</h1>
            <p>Thank you for taking time out of your schedule to coach me and give me pointers. I understand your time is valuable and I beyond appreciate that you allocated some for me. The advice you gave me and the help you provided for my portfolio and resume are invaluable and have given me not only a lot to think about, but a lot of immediate things to do. </p>
            <p> The job search is a frustrating and disheartening process and I have gotten more non-responses than I have even gotten rejections. As a junior developer, it can be hard to know what to focus on and how to step down this new path before me, but you helped me more clearly see what I have to do to journey down this road successfully with determination and hope and for that I am immensely grateful. </p>
            <p>Thank you again for your guidance and I look forward to speaking more and keeping in touch in the future.</p>
            <p>Best,</p>
            <p>Ally</p>
